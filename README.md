## Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. The objective of this study is **to identify the best model for classifying whether a female patient has diabetes**. The dataset is collected from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

The dataset consists of 9 variables:
* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
* Age: Age (years)
* Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

The classification models including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifiers were used.

## Conclusion
The **Random Forest** model is a better model for determining whether a female patient has diabetes.
